ShaderChecker
=============

Our modelers wanted a tool to help more easily QA which shaders had been assigned to which pieces of their model before sending off to render, since incorrectly assigned shaders were costly.  So I made this tool quickly to assist with that.  It allows you to quickly quick through the shaders in your scene and highlight (or isolate) which geometries are assigned to them, instead of slowly doing it through the hypershade.
